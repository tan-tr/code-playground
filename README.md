# Testing and Experimentation Project

This repository contains a collection of personal projects created for testing and experimenting purpose.These projects explore various programming concepts, libraries, and techniques. They are mainly intended for hands-on learning, trying out new ideas, and solving programming challenges.

## Purpose

The projects stored here are experiments to impoove my understanding of different concepts, such as:

* Exploring new libraries or APIs
* Testing algorithms and data structures
* Experimenting with system-level programming
* Trying out new programming language or paradigms

*These projects are not meant to be production-ready or fully structured. They serve as a sandbox for experimenting with new techniques and learning through trial and error.*
